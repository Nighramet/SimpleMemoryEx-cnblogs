# SimpleMemoryEx-cnblogs

A simple private skin for cn-blogs.

For example, this is my cn-blogs: [Nighramet's blogs](https://www.cnblogs.com/nighramet-blogs).

This project is base on [SimpleMemory](https://github.com/BNDong/Cnblogs-Theme-SimpleMemory).

Just a little change, and it is just my own taste.
